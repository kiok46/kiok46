>Our values are hypotheses, this behavior is good and important, that behavior is not. Our actions are the experiments. The resulting emotions and thought patterns are our data. There is no perfect ideology. There is only what your experiences have shown you what is right for you. And even that experience is probably somewhat wrong too, and so the wrongness of our values keeps changing over time. Weâ€™ll inevitably come to differing correct answers about what our lives mean and how should be lived.
