### My Story ðŸ‘‹


I almost failed an exam, to code.

Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to find my Ikigai. (Ikigai is the art of doing somethingâ€”and doing it with supreme focus and joy.)

The journey begins when I was a freshman at college. I had taken computer science as my major, but the truth was, I wasnâ€™t sure. I joined various clubs, events, activities, and whatnot. Confused and miserable on **24th April 2014** (The night before my annual exam) I decided to self analyze. After hours and hours of thinking, I started watching a python coding tutorial on YouTube.

Days later, I had seen 100s of videos and read numerous articles on Python, I would rush from my classes to code, Iâ€™d occasionally forget to eat, I'd neglect sleep. I had only two things to do: Play basketball and code. In 2016, I got selected in **Google Summer of Code under the Python Software Foundation**. I started paying for my college fee and a new life started.<br>Building something that could be plugged into the real world or just something cool, That is my Ikigai. (That also means I have much more to learn than just coding.)

My way of learning is aggressive, I push forward, analyze, interconnect pre-existing knowledge with the new one, create a mind map, and forge ahead.
I like learning new languages, reading books, as it gives me exposure to a different paradigm. I love meeting people and listening to their stories, learn from their experiences, and share some of my own.

Here is a quote not tightly coupled with the context above:
>Our values are hypotheses, this behavior is good and important, that behavior is not. Our actions are the experiments. The resulting emotions and thought patterns are our data. There is no perfect ideology. There is only what your experiences have shown you what is right for you. And even that experience is probably somewhat wrong too, and so the wrongness of our values keeps changing over time. Weâ€™ll inevitably come to differing correct answers about what our lives mean and how should be lived.
